# Fake_News_Detection


The Fake News Detection project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake based on their textual content. With the rise of misinformation and misleading news, this project helps in automating the verification of news authenticity using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
